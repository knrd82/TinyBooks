### A simple book rental app made as part of learning Python



This is a simple app using **basic OOP** concepts and **tkinter** for UI.
If you want to see terrible UI design straight from late 90's you came to the right place.

This is ridiculously simple app so I don't expect anybody will ever use it (even parts of it whatsoever), but if you do use it, just give me a shout.

**Comments and feedback are welcomed** as this is probably most unpythonic piece of code out here and I am still at the beginning of learning curve.

**HOW TO USE**
1. Main function is contained in 
''' UserInterface.py'''
2. CSV files need to be in the same folder as python files
3. For now it has been only tested on Windows
